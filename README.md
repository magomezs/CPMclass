# CPMclass

This repository includes:
1. A c++ class to interpret CPM caffe models and weights, obtaining person skeletons. This class is defined by the files cpm_c++.cpp and cpm_c++.h

2. A caffe python layer (parts_extractor.py) whose input is a person image blob and its outputs are nine body parts images blobs corresponging to: head, upper right arm, lower right arm, upper laeft arm, lower left arm, upper right leg, lower right leg, upper left leg, and lower left leg.
